<p><strong> The base URL of the API used throughout this section has&nbsp;changed</strong></p><p>It's not a big deal, it's really just one small change. Instead of:</p><p><code>https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/</code></p><p>It's now:</p><p><code>https://countries-api-836d.onrender.com/countries/</code></p><p><strong>So whenever we use the Countries API in this section, please just change the URL you see in the videos to this new one.</strong></p><p>Happy learning </p>
