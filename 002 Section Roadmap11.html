<p>Welcome to the section <strong>"Working With Arrays"</strong>!</p>
<p>If you want to progress through the course faster, only watch the videos marked as <strong>"Very Important"</strong> (dark green). But if you have time, then of course watch everything </p>

<p>This is actually a project section, <strong>but you don't have to follow the project!</strong> You can learn the most important array methods in isolation in the <strong>"Very Important"</strong> videos.</p>
<p>I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to skip the <strong>"Optional"</strong> (lightest green) and <strong>"Good to know"</strong> (light green) videos. Then, if you ever need one of the topics you skipped, just come back to the video later </p>
<p>And now, have fun coding! </p>
