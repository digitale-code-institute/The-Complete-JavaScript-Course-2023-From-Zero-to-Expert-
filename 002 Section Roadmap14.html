<p>Welcome to the section <strong>"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript"</strong>!</p><p>If you want to progress through the course faster, only watch the videos marked as <strong>"Very Important"</strong> (dark green). But if you have time, then of course watch everything </p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-09_08-31-33-25137877900a58a14abc5324e734508a.png" width="450"></figure><p><br></p><p>I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to skip the <strong>"Optional"</strong> (lightest green) and <strong>"Good to know"</strong> (light green) videos. Then, if you ever need one of the topics you skipped, just come back to the video later </p><p>And now, have fun coding! </p>
