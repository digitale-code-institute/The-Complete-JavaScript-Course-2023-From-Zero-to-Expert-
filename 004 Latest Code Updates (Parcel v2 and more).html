<p>1 <strong>PARCEL</strong></p><p>I use Parcel v2@<strong>BETA</strong> in the videos, but right now the <strong>stable Parcel v2</strong> has been released, and there are some differences. Don't worry, it's nothing groundbreaking, so there is no need for new videos. It's just some small adjustments in some cases </p><p> Now, if you <strong>don't</strong> run into any issues by following the videos as they are, then you don't need to do anything.</p><p> If you <strong>do have issues with Parcel</strong>, you can now find <strong>updated starter and final code</strong> in a new branch in the course repo, called <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/updates-and-fixes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updates-and-fixes </a>.</p><p> Parcel v2 has changed the way it names bundled files (the ones in the <code>dist</code> directory). You can see a JavaScript file called <code>controller.js</code> in my files, but for you, it may appear as <code>index.js</code>. Don't worry though, everything works the same.</p><p><br></p><p>2 <strong>OTHERS</strong></p><p>The updated code also uses a package called <code>Fracty</code> instead of <code>Fractional</code> for later in the project (along with some necessary code changes), as there have been some issues with deployment when using Factional.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this helps and solves any issues you might find. Let me know in the Q&amp;A if it does </p>
